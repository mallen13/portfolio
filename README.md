# Portfolio

## About
This project is my personal web development portfolio that showcases recent projects, contains information about my experience and abilities, and provides a contact form. 

## Design and Layout
The design is all original and created to be aesthetically pleasing and engaging. Colors, fonts, layout, and design were all carefully considered to create a great user experience. Animations were also used to bring attention to certain elements.

## Front-End Development 
First, project requirements and expectations were captured. After some basic design planning and wireframing, the different elements of the project were coded with semantic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. JavaScript was used to manage click events and handle form submission and post request to the back-end that I created. Google re-captcha was also implemented on the front-end to minizmize spam-bots using the contact form.

## Back-End Development
Node JS and Express JS were used on the back-end to create a simple API that takes in form data, sends an automated response HTML email, then returns a status code and message. The HTML email is sent through Nodemailer. Express-Rate-Limiter is also used to limit the number of requests that an IP can make per hour. Environment variables were used to securely store Nodemailer credentials.

## Final Touches
After completing the design and coding phase, a few individuals were asked to review the website for feedback and to test the contact form to ensure it was working as expected.
